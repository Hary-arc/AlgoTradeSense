# AI Trading Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered trading platform built with Streamlit that provides machine learning-based cryptocurrency trading signals and analysis. The platform integrates with Binance API to fetch real-time market data and uses multiple ML models (LSTM, Random Forest, SVM) to generate trading signals, perform backtesting, and provide detailed analytics.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
